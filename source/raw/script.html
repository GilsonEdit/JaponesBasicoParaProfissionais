Before We Begin

For whom is this textbook designed?
This textbook is designed for beginning learners who want to learn basic Japanese for the purpose of living and working in Japan. Unlike textbooks written primarily for students, whose content largely centers on student life, this book focuses more on social and professional life beyond school.
This textbook can be used for self-study, as part of an online course, or as a traditional college course. As a beginning level textbook, this book includes many elementary grammar patterns (Japanese Language Proficiency Test Levels 5 and 4), but the vocabulary and situations are selected specifically for working adults. Explanations are kept concise so as to only cover key points. The main focus is on oral communication.
This textbook was originally written for the first term (ten weeks) of the beginning Japanese course in the graduate program of Masters of International Management in the School of Business Administration at Portland State University. The goals of the Japanese courses are to provide students with a foundation for acquiring future business language skills and to increase students’ knowledge of Japanese culture. This is the first edition that has been piloted in the program and will be replaced with revised editions in the future.

What kind of things can you do in Japanese after finishing this book?
Based on ILR (Interagency Language Roundtable) estimates, we assume that in order for an English-speaking learner with average language aptitude to achieve the proficiency level of ILR Proficiency Scale 2: Limited Working Competence in Japanese, over one thousand hours of instruction will be required. The MIM program at PSU provides 150 hours of instruction in total. So, what can we expect our students to be able to do at the end of the program? It is not likely that they can negotiate business in Japanese or handle many professional interactions.
However, it is possible that they can handle many everyday interactions, avoid well-known taboos, answer routine questions about themselves, and network for business purposes. The topics to be covered in this textbook are:
    • Greetings and Ritual Expressions
    • Meeting People and Self-Introductions
    • Exchanging Business Cards
    • Schedules and Calendar 
    • Shopping
    • Eating and Drinking
    • Locations and Directions
    • Public Transportations
    • Family and My Profile
    • Leisure and Hobbies
    • Manners and Customs
How is this textbook structured?
This textbook is comprised of ten lessons that follow the introductory Before We Begin and Lesson 0 Greetings and Ritual Expressions sections. Each lesson consists of four dialogues. Each dialogue is followed by a vocabulary list, grammar notes, drills and exercises. At the end of each lesson, you will find a grammar review and application activities.
How is reading and writing handled in this textbook?
The modern Japanese is written using a combination of kanji (characters borrowed from China) along with hiragana and katakana (two independent systems representing Japanese syllables). While the textbook introduces hiragana and katakana, no reading or writing instruction is included in this volume.
How is Japanese pronunciation presented in this textbook?
The headphones symbol   indicates that there is an audio recording for the section marked by this symbol. The accompanying audio should be maximally used to learn all the dialogues and vocabulary lists and to practice drills. Keep in mind as you learn how to speak Japanese that you can only learn accurate pronunciation by listening to and mimicking the pronunciation of native speakers. Avoid reading off the written scripts.
When using the audio, make sure you do not refer to the written scripts. For many of us, visual input affects audio processing so much that it may interfere with accurately perceiving the audio input. You should refer to the written scripts only when you need help with particular parts of the audio. After peeking at the script, go back to the audio again.
In the first four lessons in the textbook, Japanese words and sentences are presented in Romanization (Roman alphabet representing Japanese sounds) along with the authentic Japanese script. Romanization is not meant to be an accurate representation of Japanese sounds but rather just a reminder of the sounds you hear when listening to your instructor or the audio recordings. Be particularly mindful not to pronounce Romanized Japanese as if you were reading English or any other language.
Starting in Lesson 5, Japanese words and sentences are presented using the authentic Japanese orthography.
Hiragana will be placed above kanji to indicate the correct reading. This use of kana is called furigana and is common in comic books and other publications where the writer wants to ensure the correct reading of the kanji used.
How should you use this textbook?
The dialogues present frequently observed exchanges that are part of a longer conversation. It is practical and useful to memorize these to the point where you can recite them automatically and naturally. As suggested above, make sure you memorize dialogues using the audio and while integrating body language. You can expand each dialogue by adding elements before and after each to create a longer conversation. You can also change parts of the dialogue to fit a different context. Either way, the original dialogue serves as a base to explore other possibilities.
Each dialogue has at least two drills that target key grammar patterns and vocabulary. These are rather mechanical drills that are meant to train quick and automatic formation of language. The recommended procedure for these drill practices is to first listen to the two model exchanges and understand what changes to make in responding to the cues. Look at the scripts for the models if you are not sure what to do. Listen to the first cue, insert your response during the following pause, listen to the model answer, and repeat the model answer during the second pause. Repeat this procedure for the following cues. It is recommended that you loop back to the beginning of the drill frequently. Always give yourself a chance to respond to the cues before you listen to the model answer. Also think of the meaning as you do these drills. Needless to say, it doesn't make sense to just keep repeating the sounds you hear without knowing what you are saying.
Two types of exercises will follow the mechanical drills. The first is ‘Say It in Japanese,’ which is a translation activity. The last exercise ‘Act in Japanese’ is a role-play exercise, in which students can freely respond to each other within the given context and expand the suggested interchange into a longer interaction. For this exercise, students are encouraged to perform the roles as naturally as possible integrating body language, facial expressions, etc.
By answering the grammar review questions at the end of each lesson, you will self assess your understanding of the grammar before moving onto the next lesson. The parentheses at the end of each question indicate in which grammar note to find the answer to the question.
For Practical Applications, which concludes each lesson, it is suggested that relevant authentic materials such as restaurant menus, shopping mall directories, apartment listings, etc. are extensively used to accommodate the real-world application of what has been practiced. Students are encouraged to freely and realistically ask and answer questions and exchange comments regarding those materials.
Last but not least…
Make a clear distinction between knowing the material (Fact) and being able to use the material in spontaneous conversations (Act). You may learn grammar quickly, but it takes a great deal of repetitive practice to develop the skills to speak Japanese in real-life situations. At the end of the day, it doesn’t mean much if you cannot respond orally to a native speaker in a culturally appropriate way no matter how well you can answer grammar questions or recite vocabulary in isolation. In studying Japanese, always keep in mind the objectives and how best to reach them.
Have fun!

Grammar Notes
1-1-1	Verbos, Não-passado, Formal, Afirmativo e Negativo 
Verbos ocorrem ao final de uma sentença em japonês. Um único verbo comprime uma sentença completa. Ao contrário do inglês, o qual requer um sujeito, o objeto e o sujeito são dispensáveis em japonês se o contexto permitir. Então, no diálogo acima, o senhor Smith apenas diz “wakarimasu ka” para checar a compreensão da colega de trabalho. Ele não menciona “você” ou “o relatório”, os quais são óbvios pelo contexto.
Verbos em japonês terminam em -masu (Afirmativo, não-passado, formal), -masen (Negativo, não-passado, formal) e outras formas, as quais serão apresentadas posteriormente.
Não-passado refere-se à ações realizadas frequentemente ou que serão realizadas posteriormente. Não refere-se à ações que estão sendo feitas.
Formal refere-se ao vocabulário cortês. Essa forma é utilizada tipicamente ao dirigir-se com superiores, pessoas recentemente conhecidas ou estrangeiros. É recomendado que estudantes do idioma utilizem-na. 

//Verbs occur at the end of a sentence in Japanese. A lone verb can comprise a complete sentence.  Unlike English, where a subject is required, the subject and object are usually not mentioned in Japanese if they are understood from the context.  So, in the dialogue above, Mr. Smith simply says Wakarimasu ka in order to find out if a coworker understands the report.  He does not mention ‘you’ or ‘the report’, which are obvious from the context.
	A Japanese verb ends in -masu (Affirmative, Non-Past, Formal) and –masen (Negative, Non-Past, Formal) as well as other forms, which will be introduced later. 
Non-past refers to an act that is performed regularly or will be performed in the future.  It does NOT refer to an act that is currently being performed.
	Formal refers to speaking courteously.  This form is used typically when speaking to superiors, people you meet for the first time, or strangers.  It is a safer form to use when learners first start speaking Japanese.//
1-1-2 	 Hai e Iie:  Afirmações e negações
	Hai significa “assim como você disse”, independente se a sentença é afirmativa ou negativa. Ee é menos formal em relação à Hai 
	//Hai means ‘what you said is right’ regardless of whether the sentence is affirmative or negative.  Ee is a less formal than hai.//

Wakarimasu ka. 		Entendeu?
	Hai, wakarimasu. 	Sim, entendi.

Wakarimasen ka. 		Não entendeu?
	Ee, sumimasen. 	Uhum, desculpe.

	Iie significa “O que você disse é incorreto”, independentemente se a sentença é afirmativa ou negativa. Iya é menos formal do que Iie//Iie means ‘what you said is incorrect’ regardless of whether the sentence is affirmative or negative.  Iya is less formal than iie./

Wakarimasu ka. 		Entendeu?
	Iie, wakarimasen. 	Não, não entendi.

Wakarimasen ne. 		Não entendeu, né?
	Iya, wakarimasu yo. 	Não, eu entendi.
1-1-3 	Partículas Ka e Ne(e)
Partículas tais como ka e ne(e) são anexadas à sentenças. Ka indica uma interrogação.
//Sentence particles such as ka and ne(e) attach to a sentence. Ka is a question marker.//

Tabemasu. 	Comi.
Tabemasu ka. 	Você comeu?

	Ne(e) com queda na entonação indica que o referente compartilha os mesmo sentimentos que você. Ele auxilia na importante impressão cultural de que você e o referente compartilham dos mesmos sentimentos ou opinião. Quando utilizado com uma entonação de pergunta, indica que você está conferindo a sua dedução sobre um fato.

//Ne(e) with falling intonation indicates that you assume the addressee shares your feelings.  It helps create the culturally important impression that you and the addressee share the same feeling or opinion.  When used with a question intonation, you are checking if your assumption is in fact correct.

Yoku nomimasu nee. 		Você bebe bastante, não é!
Wakarimasen nee. 	Acho que nós não sabemos.
Tabemasen ne? 	Você não comeu, né?
1-1-4 	Advérbios
	Advérbios aparecem anterior à verbos em sentenças japonesas e indicam: o quanto, quão frequente ou em qual maneira algo ocorre. [Amari] e [zenzen] combinam com negativos e indicam o grau em que algo ocorre. (Zenzen combinado a uma afirmação indica um grau inesperado de coloquialidade.
	
//Adverbs appear before the verb in a Japanese sentence and indicate how much, how often, or in what manner something happens. Amari and zenzen combine with a negative and indicate the degree to which something happens. (Zenzen combined with an affirmative indicates an unexpected degree in colloquial Japanese)//

Amari tabemasen. 		Eu não como muito.
Zenzen hanashimasen. 	Eu não falo muito.

Yoku significa “bem, muito ou frequentemente”, variando de acordo com o contexto.//Yoku means ‘well, a lot, or frequently’ depending on the context. 

Yoku wakarimasu.		 Eu entendo bem.
Yoku kaimasu. 	Eu compro muito/ frequentemente.

Notas de gramática
1-2-1	Nome+verbo
Como visto no Diálogo 1 acima, o sujeito, objeto e outros elementos são implícitos se o contexto permitir. Caso contrário, coloque-os antes do verbo.//As seen in Dialogue 1 above, subject, object and other elements are usually not explicitly mentioned in Japanese when they are clear from the context.  But when not clear, you can place them before the verb.//

Are, tabemasu ka.	Você come aquilo?
Kore, zenzen wakarimasen. 	Eu não entendo isso.

Nomes relacionam-se com verbos em diversas maneiras.//Nouns can relate to sentence verbs in a variety of ways.//

	Sujeito		Honda-san nomimasu ka. 	A senhorita Honda bebe?
	Objeto		Kore tsukaimasu ne. 		Utilizaremos isso, né?’
	
Mais categorias serão introduzidas posteriormente. //More categories will be introduced later.//  
Mais de uma dessas pode aparecer em uma sentença. A ordem mais comum é://More than one of these can appear in a sentence.  The common word order is://

	Tempo--Sujeito--Objeto--Advérbio--Verbo
	Time--Subject--Object--Adverb--Verb

	Watashi kore ypoku wakarimasu. 	I understand this well.

However, while the verb needs to appear at the end, noun order is relatively flexible.  When sentence elements are not in the common order above, the element moved forward has more focus.

	Kore, watashi yoku wakarimasu 	This, I understand well.

1-2-2	Os formatos Ko, so, a, do
	Ao referir-se à coisas em inglês, utiliza-se “this”(próximo ao falante) e “that”(distante ao falante). Em japonês, existem três métodos:

//When referring to things in English, a two-way distinction between this (close to the speaker) and that (away from the speaker) is made.  In Japanese, a three-way distinction is made://

kore 	essa coisa (próxima de mim) ou isso que eu mencionei
sore 	essa coisa (próxima a você) ou aquilo que foi mencionado há pouco
are 	aquela coisa (longe de nós dois) ou aquilo que nós dois conhecemos
dore	qual

Esse é o primeiro grupo de expressões baseados em ko,so,a,do. Existem demais grupos baseados nessa mesma distinção, os quais apresentam expressões como: “X tipo”, “X maneira”, “X lugar”.//This is the first set of expressions based on the ko-so-a-do distinction. There are more sets that are based on the same distinction. We refer to that group as the Ko-so-a-do series, which includes expressions such as ‘X kind’, ‘X way’, X place’, etc. These will be introduced later.
1-2-3	Partícula Kedo
Kedo (mas) conecta duas sentenças em uma única. Geralmente as duas sentenças possuem ideias contrastantes, porém, algumas vezes a primeira sentença serve apenas para preparar o ouvinte para uma sentença posterior.
//Kedo ‘but’ connects two sentences to make one.  The two sentences typically contain contrasting ideas but sometimes the first sentence simply serves as an introduction and prepares the listener for the second sentence.//
	Kore wa kaimasu kedo, are wa kaimasen.  Comprarei isso, mas não comprarei aquilo.
	Sumimasen kedo, wakarimasen.  Desculpe, mas não entendo.
	Honda desu kedo, shiturei-shimasu.  Eu sou Honda, permita-me entrar. (ao adentrar uma sala)

A segunda sentença é comumente inexpressiva, pois é explícita pelo contexto ou porque o falante hesita em continuar por quaiquer motivos. No diálogo acima, o Senhor Smith provavelmente deseja soar menos brusco  enquanto aguarda comentários de outros falantes.//The second sentence is often left unexpressed because it is clear from the context or because the speaker hesitates to mention it for some reason. In the dialogue above, Mr. Smith probably wanted to sound less abrupt and is inviting comments from the other speakers.//

Kaimasu kedo… eu vou comprar, mas… (Você permite? / Porquê perguntou?)
	
Ga é mais formal em relação à kedo e mais comum em escrita e discursos formais. Existem diversas variantes: keredo, kedomo e keredomo, as quais também são mais formais.//Ga is more formal than kedo and is more common in writing and formal speeches. There are also several variations of kedo such as keredo, kedomo, and keredomo, which are more formal than kedo. //
1-2-4	Partícula Wa indicando contraste
A partícula wa segue nomes e indica contraste entre esse nome discutido e outras possibilidades. O nome pode ser sujeito, objeto ou outra categoria.//Particle wa follows nouns and indicates a contrast between that noun under discussion and other possibilities.   The noun can be subject, object, or some other category.//

Watashi wa mimasu kedo…   Eu assisti, mas…(outra pessoa pode não ter assistido)
Kore wa wakarimasu.		Eu entendi isto (mas não aquilo)
	Ashita wa kaimasu.	Vou comprá-lo amanhã (mas não hoje)

Quando a partícula wa anexa em algum nome com uma entonação de pergunta, significa “O que acha de X?”, como apresentado no diálogo acima. Não responda esse pergunta com “sim” ou “não”, pois não é uma pergunta de sim-ou-não.//When particle wa attaches to a noun with a question intonation, it means ‘how about X?’ as in the dialogue above.  In answering this type of question, make sure you do not reply “yes” or “no”, since it’s not a yes-no question.	//

1-2-5	Partícula Mo
	A partícula Mo age de forma contrária à partícula wa. A partícula Mo significa “também” ou “e” com um verbo afirmativo e “também não” com um verbo negativo. Ela pode ser anexada ao sujeito, objeto ou tempo.

Notas de gramática
1-3-1	Perguntas negativas como sugestões//Negative Questions as Suggestions
	Perguntas negativas são utilizadas para sugerir ou convidar em algumas ocasiões//Negative questions are sometimes used to suggest or invite to do certain actions.

Tabemasen ka		Não vai comer? or Vamos comer?
Ikimasen ka.	Você não vai? or Vamos?

Quando você aceitar um convite, é cortês que diga Doumo ou Arigatou Gozaimasu, caso contrário, não recuse diretamente, é mais adequado que você deixe subtendido a recusa. Torne o contexto ambíguo dizendo “chotto” e pareça desconfortado, falando de forma lenta e sutil.

//When accepting the invitation, it’s polite to say Doumo or Arigatou gozaimasu.
When turning down the invitation, avoid saying no directly.  It’s best to instead leave things ambiguous by saying chotto and sound hesitant by speaking slowly and elongating vowels.

	Kore tabemasen ka. 	Quer um pouco disso aqui?
		Aceitando//Accepting: 	Arigatou gozaimasu. Ja, chotto itadakimasu. 
Obrigado, vou experimentar.//Thank you.  I’ll have a little, then.
		Recusando: Iyaa, chottooo…  Bem… é que...
1-3-2	Chotto: O anti-impacto
Chotto significa “pequeno/pouco”, porém, é comumente utilizado para tornar o contexto de uma conversa mais leve. Por exemplo, como explicado em GN 1-3-1, é mais educado falar chotto ao recusar algo à dizer simplesmente “não”. O uso de chotto com essa finalidade é bastante evidente no japonês diário para evitar situações constrangedoras ou indelicadas. Confira abaixo: 
//Chotto literally means ‘a little’.  However, it is often used as an impact softener during a conversation when less-than favorable information is presented. For example, as explained in GN 1-3-1, it’s polite to just say chotto when rejecting an invitation or request, rather than saying no.  The efforts to avoid an unpleasant or awkward situation is evidenced in the frequent use of chotto in Japanese communication.  Here are some examples.
    • Chamar atenção de alguém//To get attention from others
    • //To be humble:
        ◦ When accepting something offered:
Ja, chotto itadakimasu.  Then, I’ll take just a little.
        ◦ When asked if you know something well:
Chotto wakarimasu kedo…  I understand a little, but…
    • //To soften impact:
        ◦ When making a request
Suimasen. Chotto onegai-shimasu.  Excuse me. Can I just ask a favor?
        ◦ When you do not know the answer to a question:
Chotto wakarimasen nee.  I just do not know.
        ◦ When you suggest taking a break, regardless of the actual length of the break:
Chotto, yasumimasen ka? Shall we take a short break? 
1-3-3   Aizuchi: Como ser um bom ouvinte//Aizuchi: How to be a Good Listener
Quando você participa de uma conversa em japonês, é esperado que você reaja constantemente e mostre que você está engajado. Você reage através de “hm”, “hai”, “sou desu ka”, “aa”, expressões faciais e outros.
Isso é chamado de Aizuchi.

Você provavelmente já ouviu muitos japoneses utilizar a partícula nee enquanto acenam com a cabeça. Isso quer dizer que o ouvinte está atento ao quer você fala. Então, não permaneça apenas olhando com uma expressão apática, sorria e acene.
//When you participate in a Japanese conversation you are expected to give frequent feedback and show that you are engaged. Feedback includes nodding, making facial expressions, and using short expressions such as hai, soo desu ka, aa and others.
All these are called Aizuchi.

	//You probably hear Japanese speakers use the sentence particle nee frequently and see them nodding equally frequently. Nodding means ‘I’m listening’, but not necessarily means ‘I agree.’  So, don’t just stair and listen with a poker face.   Nod, smile, and say,
Aa, soo desu ka.
1-3-4   Referências Pessoais//Personal References
	Watashi (“eu”) é uma forma de referência comum no japonês, utilizada pelo falante ao referir-se à si próprio, então é uma ótima escolha para estudantes iniciantes. Boku é informal em relação à watashi e utilizado apenas por homens. Posteriormente, outras formas serão apresentadas, as quais cada uma possui diferenças em formalidade e características, então, é necessário cautela ao utilizá-las.
	Diferente do inglês, no qual o pronome “você”  é comumente utilizado para o referente, em japonês existem diversas formas de referir-se à alguém. A forma de referência em japonês a ser escolhida é definida de acordo com o contexto e a relação do falante com o referente. A forma -san é a mais comum, porém sensei e outros títulos são necessários ao referir-se à sujeitos que possuam títulos que carregam esses termos. Então, não utilize -san ao invés de títulos necessários, pois é rude.
	Além disso, o anexo ou desanexo de -san ao primeiro nome é informal, então trata-se de um recuso destinado para situações entre amigos ou subordinados. Também tenha cuidado ao utilizar anata (você). Diferentemente do uso de “você” em inglês, anata possui um uso muito restrito em japonês, normalmente destinado para referências anônimas, então é rude utilizá-lo  quando o nome do referente é conhecido.
	Seja cortês ao referir-se à alguém. Sempre utilize -san ou outro pronome de tratamento como sensei. Utilize outras formas de tratamento quando for requisitado.Lembre-se de não utilizar watashi ou qualquer outra forma de referência constantemente. Esse é um dos erros cometidos por estrangeiros que são nativos em idiomas que necessitam de formas de referência.
	

//Watashi ‘I’ is the most common reference to oneself in Japanese, which is probably the safest form to use for beginning learners. Boku is only used by male speakers, and less formal than watashi. Other forms will be introduced later, which have different shades of formality and other elements, and thus require more care in using them.
Unlike English, where the pronoun you is used for the addressee in most cases, there are many ways to address and refer to others in Japanese. To decide how to call a person in Japanese, you need to consider your relationship with the person and the circumstances. Last name + san is most common, but sensei ‘teacher’ and other titles are required to address and refer to people in such positions.  Using –san instead of the titles can be rude. First name with or without –san is more informal and used among friends or to those in the subordinate positions.  Be extra careful with the word anata ‘you’.  Unlike its English equivalent, anata has very limited use, usually for anonymous addressees, and is inappropriate if you know the person’s name or title.

	When deciding how to call a person, be conservative.  Start with last name + san or a title such as sensei. Switch to more casual alternatives when requested. Be careful about timing. A switch is usually initiated by the superior.

	Another caution is to not overuse watashi or any personal reference for that matter.  Recall that the subject is not mentioned in Japanese when clearly understood from the context. Overuse of personal reference is one of the most common errors made by foreigners whose native language requires them in a sentence. //
1-3-5   Partícula Yo//Sentence Particle Yo Indicating New Information
	Diferentemente da partícula ne(e), q qual indica compartilhamento de sentimentos/informações entre ambos indivíduos, a partícula yo indica que o falante está apresentando uma informação possivelmente desconhecida pelo ouvinte. Então é utilizada frequentemente para corrigir informações. No diálogo abaixo, o senhor Yamada utiliza a partícula yo para destacar à senhorita Honda que ele está saindo.
	Poupa-me palavras destacar que ao corrigir alguém, primeiro certifique-se de que você está em posição para fazer isso e então fazer corretamente.

//Unlike the particle ne(e), which indicates the shared information, the particle yo indicates that the speaker thinks this is new information to the listener.   So, it is often used to correct or assure someone.  In the dialogue above, Mr. Yamada tries to assure Ms. Honda that he is going by using this particle at the end.

Needless to say, when correcting someone, you need to first make sure that you are in a position to do so, and then do it appropriately.

Grammar Notes
1-4-1	Verbs in the Past Form
	As explained in 1-1-1 above, the verb -masu form is Non-Past and indicates both present and future. Past is indicated by changing -masu to -mashita (Affirmative) and -masen to -masen deshita (Negative).  Here is a chart that shows all forms.
Table 2.  Affirmative forms of verbs in both past and non-past

Affirmative
Negative
Non-past
-masu
-masen
Past
-mashita
-masen deshita
1-4-2 Compound Verbs
	/Noun + shimasu / combinations are compound verbs. Many nouns that mean actions such as renshuu ‘practice’ and benkyou ‘study’ appear in this pattern. When verbs in English are borrowed into Japanese, -shimasu is attached to them and they become Japanese verbs.  Make sure you pronounce them in the Japanese way.

Meeru-shimasu yo.  I’ll email (or text) you.
Getto-shimasu.  I’ll get it/I’ll obtain it.
Appuroodo-shimasu.  I’ll upload it.

Grammar Notes
2-1-1/Noun + desu / ‘is N’ / Noun + ja nai desu/ ‘is not N’
/X desu/ means ‘is X’ (Affirmative) and /X ja nai desu/ means ‘is not X’ (Negative). These noun sentences are Non-Past and Formal.

Ame desu yo. It’s raining.
Kore wa gakkou desu ka. Is this a school?
Honda-san ja nai desu ka?	Aren’t you Ms. Honda?

A negative question can be also used 1) to show some uncertainty, and 2) to politely correct someone.
    1) Ima, na-ji desu ka. - What time is it?
Yo-ji ja nai desu ka? - Isn’t it four?
    2) San-ji desu yo. - It’s three.
Anou, yo-ji ja nai desu ka. - Umm, isn’t it four?

Recall that what is obvious from the context is usually not mentioned in Japanese.
In the dialogue above, Ms. Tanaka sees Michael going somewhere, and checks if he is going to work. All she has to say is ‘Is it work (that you are going to)?’

A sentence X wa Y desu is usually translated as ‘X is Y’. However, unlike the English translation, where X equals Y (Y is the identity of X), the interpretation of the Japanese sentence is more open and flexible. Consider the following:

Honda-san wa shigoto desu.

This sentence does not mean ‘Ms. Honda IS work’, but rather for Ms. Honda what is under discussion is the work.  So, there are numerous possible interpretations depending on the context. For example, she is at work, her priority is her work, her plan for the weekend is to work, what she likes is her job, to list a few. So, be aware of the context and be imaginative. Now, test your imagination. What can the following possibly mean?
Honda-san wa Panda desu.
2-1-2 Clock Time
Hours are named by attaching –ji to the number. Minutes will be introduced later. You can attach –han to the hour to mean ‘half past the hour’. Note that, unlike English, when asking what time it is, ima ’now’ is commonly used in Japanese, as shown in the dialogue above.
2-1-3 Hesitation Noises: Anou and Etto
Hesitation noises are very common in Japanese conversations. Without them, a conversation may sound too mechanical and abrupt. Japanese conversations tend to favor less direct and less confrontational exchanges. ‘Beating around the bush’ may not be such a bad thing when speaking Japanese. One way to do it is to use hesitation noises. A lot of them!
Anou and etto are two of the most common hesitation noises in Japanese. Anou is the all mighty hesitation noise while etto indicates that you are searching for the right answer. So, when asked what your name is, for example, anou is fine, but not etto. Anou is also used to get attention from a person, but not etto.
Besides the hesitation noises, you also hear Japanese speakers elongating the last vowel of each word, or inserting desu ne between chunks of words to slow down speech.

Imaaa, anooo, Honda-san waaaa, shigotooo desu.	Honda is at work now.
Ashita desu ne, anoo desu ne zenbu desu ne tsukurimasu. I’ll make all tomorrow.

Grammar Notes
2-2-1 Noun no Noun
When one noun describes another in Japanese they are connected together by particle no. /X no Y/ means a kind of Y, which is described by X. Multiple nouns can be connected by particle no, but always the last noun is the main noun. Compare the following:

pasokon no kaisya	a computer company
kaisya no pasokon	a computer in the company
America no pasokon no kaisya	a computer company in the US
America no kaisya no pasokon	a computer (made by) an American
company

The relationship between the main noun and other noun(s) varies greatly depending on their meaning. The following are some examples.

Location	Nihon no daigaku	colleges in Japan
Affiliation	J-Netto no Maikeru	Michael from J-Net
Possession	watashi no baggu	my bag
Time	san-ji no baito	work from 3 o’clock
Subgroup	Amerika no Pootorando	Porltand, US,
	daigakuin no ichi-nensei	First year graduate student
Status	ryuugakusei no Hiru-san	Mr/s. Hill, an exchange student
2-2-2 Loan Words
Japanese has borrowed words and phrases from other languages. The majority of Japanese loanwords these days come from English. When words are borrowed, they go through some changes. First, their pronunciation changes to fit the Japanese sound system. Make sure you learn how your name is pronounced in Japanese. Second, these words usually become nouns, regardless of what they were in their original language.
Third, their meaning in Japanese may be different.
As explained in GN1-4-2, by attaching –simasu, many borrowed words that are verbs in the original language can be used as verbs in Japanese (kopii-shimasu ‘copy’). If the original words/phrases are long, they get abbreviated and become very different words from the original (sumaho for smart phone). It’s common to abbreviate two-word phrases by taking the first two syllables from each and combine them to make four syllable words (pasokon for personal computer).

2-2-3 Introductions and Exchange of Business Cards
It’s customary in business situations to exchange business cards when meeting someone for the first time. Keep your cards ready. As you present your card (with both hands, palms up), bow and turn it so that the other person can read it. As you receive the other person’s card, take a moment to read/acknowledge it. You can place their business cards in front of you during the meeting to refer to.
Self-introductions are very common in Japan, during which a person gets up in front of a group and explains who he/she is. These follow a formula, which starts with hajimemashite, followed by your name (even if it has already been mentioned) and other information, and closes with douzo yoroshiku onegai shimasu.
Remember to bow as you introduce yourself, and nod when others bow. It’s better to be safe and bow more often than sorry by bowing too little. When in doubt, bow!

Grammar Notes
2-3-1 Echo Questions
As we have seen, it’s common for things that are clear from the context to be left unsaid in Japanese conversation. However, the context may not always be clear to everyone involved. In such cases, people use echo questions (echoing back all or part of what has just been said) for clarification. In the dialogue above, the staff member uses the echo question ‘Do you mean this?’ to check if Michael is referring to the handouts near her.

Michael: Sore, nan desu ka.	What is that?
Staff:	Kore desu ka. Kyou no sukejuuru desu.	This? It’s today’s schedule.

While echo questions are not unique to Japanese, they occur a lot more frequently in Japanese conversations. This is because echo questions are not only used for clarification, but also to slow down the pace of conversation or soften the tone. Recall that hesitation noises are used to take time and avoid direct responses. Echo questions are often used for similar purposes. So, even when there is no need for clarification, Japanese speakers may ask echo questions. In such cases, an answer to the echo question is not necessarily expected.
The most common echo questions are those that repeat the topic nouns, which may have been left unsaid or which are typically marked by the particle wa in the other person’s speech.

Wakarimasu ka?	Do [you] understand?
-Watashi desu ka. Iya, amari…	Do you mean me? Not really.
Kore wa sumaho desu ka.	Is this a smartphone?
-Kore desu ka. Hai.	Do you mean this? Yes.

Note here that ‘Sumaho desu ka.’ is impossible as an echo question. Watch out!

*-Sumaho desu ka? Hai.	Do you mean a smartphone? Yes.
2-3-2 Ano X	Ko-so-a-do series #2
In Lesson 1, the first set of ko-so-a-do series (kore, sore, are, dore) was introduced. The second set of the series is kono, sono, ano, and dono. Both sets are based on the same ko-so-a-do distinction (near the speaker, close to the addressee, or away from both).
The difference between the two sets is that the first is a set of nouns and the second is a set of incomplete elements that require a following noun and cannot be used alone. So, while kore is an independent noun meaning ‘this’, kono is linked to a noun, meaning ‘this X’. Note that when translated into English, both kore and kono are translated as ‘this’.

kore	this
kono kaisha	this company
kono nihon no kaisya this Japanese company

Grammar Notes
2-4-1 Days of the Week
Youbi indicates days of the week. There are three variations for each day of the week.

getsu, getsu-you, getsu-youbi

The longer, the more formal. Abbreviations like the following are also very common.

Getsu-sui-kin Mon-Wed-Fri
Kaa-moku	Tue-Thurs.
Do-nichi	Sat-Sun
The question word nan-youbi ‘what day of the week’ cannot be used to ask ‘what day of the month’, which will be introduced later.
2-4-2 Noun to Noun
/X to Y/ means ‘X and Y’. Unlike English ‘and’, which can connect various elements including adjectives, verbs, or sentences, the particle to can only connect nouns or noun phrases.

Nihon to America	Japan and America
Asia Ginkou no Oda-san to J-Netto no Sumisu-san
Mr. Oda from Asia Bank and Mr. Smith from J-Net Kayoubi to mokuyoubi no jugyou	Classes on Tuesday and Thursday Kono nihongo no kyoukasho to ano hon	this Japanese textbook and that book

Like other particles, to follows a noun, and when pronouncing, there is no pause between the noun and to (in English, you can pause before ‘and.’) There is no limit to the number of nouns connected, but it’s rare for an adult speaker to list more than three or four.

2-4-3 The Past Form of /X desu/	X deshita, X ja nakatta desu
The forms of /X desu/ including the Non-Past, Past, Affirmative and Negative are shown in the chart below. Make sure you do not use deshita in the Past Negative form.
Table 3. Conjucation of non-past and past-forms of -desu in the affirmative and negative.

Affirmative
Negative
Non-past
Nihongo desu.
It’s Japanese.
Nihongo ja nai desu.
It’s not Japanese.
Past
Nihongo deshita.
It was Japanese.
Nihongo ja nakatta desu.
It wasn’t Japanese.

The Past forms are also used to express recollection of information, even when it is information about an event scheduled in the future.

Kaigi wa ashita deshita ne.	The meeting was tomorrow, right?
-Iya, asatte ja nakatta desu ka?	No, wasn’t it the day after tomorrow?

Grammar Notes
3-1-1 Adjective Sentences
All adjectives in Japanese end in -i (Non Past), -katta (Past), and -ku. takai	expensive
	takaku nai	not expensive
To make the Past form, change -i to -katta. For the negative form, change nai to nakatta.
takakatta	was expensive
takaku nakatta	was not expensive To make a formal style adjective sentence, add desu.
Takai desu.	It’s expensive. Takaku nai des.	It’s not expensive. Takakatta desu.	It was expensive. Takaku nakatta desu. It was not expensive.
In Lessons 1 and 2 verb sentences and noun sentences were introduced.  With the adjective sentences introduced in this lesson you have now seen all three Japanese sentence types. The chart below shows the forms that have been introduced so far.
Table 4.  Examples of affirmative and negative non-past types of verb, noun, and adjective sentences in Japanese.

Non-past – Affirmative
Non-Past – Negative
Verb Sentence
Wakarimasu.
Wakarimasen.
Noun
Sentence
Nihon desu.
Nihon ja nai desu.
Adjective Sentence
Takai desu.
Takaku nai desu.
Table 5. Affirmative and negative past types of verb, noun, and adjective sentences in Japanese.

Past - Negative
Past - Affirmative
Verb Sentence
Wakarimashita.
Wakarimasen deshita.
Noun
Sentence
Nihon deshita.
Nihon ja nakatta desu.
Adjective Sentence
Takakatta desu.
Takaku nakatta desu.

The adjective ii has special forms. This is the only exception in the entire class of adjectives.
Ii desu	It’s good
Yoku nai desu	It’s not good
Yokatta desu	It was good.
Yoku nakatta desu.	It wasn’t good.
Yoku is one of the most commonly used adverbs and was already introduced in Lesson 1 as in
yoku wakarimasu, yoku tabemasu, etc. Yokatta desu nee is a common response to good news.
3-1-2 Adjective + Noun
In Lesson 2, you saw two ways of extending a noun into a noun phrase. One way is to modify a noun by another, as in the sequence /X no Y/ in the phrase Amerika no kaisha ‘American company.’ Another example is the kono-sono-ano-dono group that precedes a noun, as in ano kaisha ‘that company’. These two ways can be combined as in kono Amerika no kaisha ‘this American company.’
Adjectives can directly modify a noun to make a noun phrase (no need for the particle no).
takai keitai	expensive cellphone
takaku nai keitai	cellphone that is not expensive
It’s possible to combine more than one adjective or other modifying elements to extend a noun phrase.
chiisai takai keitai	small, expensive cellphone
kono Amerika no chiisai takai keitai this small, expensive American cellphone

Note that all the modifying elements occur before the main noun, and that the particle no must be attached to a noun modifier wherever it occurs. The order of modifying elements is rather free, unlike in English, where there are certain restrictions.
chiisai takai kono Amerika no keitai this small, expensive American cellphone
kono watashi no keitai	this cellphone of mine
watashi no kono keitai	this cellphone of mine
3-1-3 arimasu	‘there is X’
The verb arimasu means ‘there is’ or ‘I have’. It indicates inanimate existence such as objects, plants, ideas, events, etc. A different verb is used for people and animals and will be introduced later. There are two negative forms for arimasu: arimasen and nai desu. The latter is less formal.
As we have seen so far, nai desu is part of the negative forms for noun and adjective sentences. Arimasen can substitute for nai desu in these forms and sounds a little more elegant.
Sumaho ja nai desu.	→ Sumaho ja arimasen.	It’s not a smartphone.
Takaku nai desu.	→ Takaku arimasen.	It’s not expensive.
Similarly, the Past form arimasen deshita can substitute for nakatta desu.
Sumaho ja nakatta desu. → Sumaho ja arimasen deshita. It wasn’t a smartphone.
Takaku nakatta desu.	→ Takaku arimasen deshita.	It wasn’t expensive.
The chart below shows all the forms including these alternatives.

Grammar Notes
3-2-1 Numbers and Classifiers (~en, ~doru, ~ban)
Japanese numbers are listed at the end of this lesson. Note that numbers 4, 7 and 9 have alternating forms: yon, yo and shi for 4, nana and shichi for 7 and kyuu and ku for 9. The form depends on what classifier is combined with the number (See below for classifiers).
In Japanese, numbers with five or more places are counted in groups of four places
( ~man, ~oku, ~chou). On the other hand, in English these numbers are counted by groups of threes places (thousands, millions, billions). So, ten thousand in Japanese has a special name man, and succeeding groups of four places have the names ~oku, and ~chou. Traditionally a comma was inserted every four places (10,000 was written 1,0000).
Note that 10, 100 and 1000 do not require ichi, but 10,000 does. In another words, you need to say ichi only for the last place in each four-place group.

1	ichi	10000	ichi-man
10	juu	100000	juu-man
100	hyaku	1000000	hyaku-man
1000	sen	10000000	sen-man

So, ¥11111111 is sen hyaku juu ichi man sen hyaku juu ichi en. Also note the following sound changes.
For 100’s (hyaku)	h→ b 300 sanbyaku; ?00 nanbyaku (how many hundreds?) h→ pp 600 roppyaku; 800 happyaku
For 1000’s (sen)	s→z	3000 sanzen; ?000 nanzen (how many thousands?) s→ss	8000 hassen
Japanese numbers are usually followed by a classifier, which indicates what is counted or numbered. Use of ‘bare’ numbers is rather limited (counting the number of push-ups, etc.) When counting things in Japanese, numbers are combined with classifiers that are conventionally used for the particular nouns being counted. This is similar to English expressions like “ten sheets of paper” (not ten papers), or “a loaf of bread” (not a bread.)
Recall that the classifier for clock time is –ji, and grade in school is –nensei. We add three more in this lesson: –en for the Japanese currency, –doru for US currency, and –ban for numbers in order (first, second, etc.) Before –ji, 4, 7, and 9 are respectively yo, shichi, and ku. As shown in the chart below, before –en the number 4 is yo, and the numbers 7 and 9 before –en, doru and –ban are nana, and kyuu.
The classifier -ban is also used for ranking (first place, second place, etc.) Ichi-ban is also used as an adverb to mean ‘most’ or ‘best.’ The pitch accent changes for the adverbial use (iCHIban
→ iCHIBAN)
Ichi-ban jouzu	most skillful
Ichi-ban atarashii	newest
Ichiban ii daigaku	the best college

3-2−2	Pronoun No
Recall that we have the following three noun phrase structures.

1. Adjective + Noun	yasui apaato	cheap apartment
2. Kono + Noun	kono apaato	this apartment
3. Noun no Noun	watashi no apaato	my apartment
It sounds too wordy and unsophisticated if the same noun is repeated unnecessarily. How can we avoid repeating the main noun in these structures when it is already known from the context?
For Structure 1, replace the noun with the pronoun no.  → yasui no	inexpensive one For Structure 2, use kore-sore-are-dore, instead.	→ kore		this
For Structure 3, just drop it.	→ watashi no mine

The pronoun no can replace the noun directly after an adjective, but is usually not used to refer to people. These rules hold when the three structures are combined.
`
kono atarashii apaato 	this new apartment	→ kono atarashii no
watashi no kono kaban 	this bag of mine	→ watashi no kore atarashii Amerika no kaisha   new American company	→ atarashii Amerika no
3-2-3 ka nee ‘I wonder’
Some sentence particles can occur in combination. One common combination is ka nee ‘I wonder.’ Ka indicates doubt and nee indicates that the speaker assumes the hearer has the same doubt. In the dialogue above, Michael asks if there are cheaper apartments, assuming Ms. Honda understands his situation. Compare the following:
Motto yasui no wa arimasen ka.	Aren't there cheaper ones?
Motto yasui no wa arimasen ka nee. I wonder if there are cheaper ones.
While the first asks for an answer, the second does not demand a response because the speaker assumes that the other person shares the same question. The result is softer. Ka nee is also used as a polite response to a question when the speaker does not know the answer.
Ano hito dare desu ka?	Who is that person?
-Dare desu ka nee.	I wonder, too.
Dare no kasa desu ka?	Whose umbrella is it?
-Dare no desu ka nee. I wonder whose it is, too.

Grammar Notes
3-3-1 Na-Nouns
When one noun describes another, there are two possible patterns. You’ve seen one of these already with the particle no: watashi no keitai ‘my cell phone,’ nihongo no sensei ‘the Japanese teacher.’
A smaller set of nouns hooks up to nouns with the particle na: kirei na nihongo ‘beautiful Japanese,’ benri na keitai ‘convenient cell phone.’ These will be called “na nouns.” All na nouns are intangible, but not all intangibles are na nouns. All na nouns will be followed by (na) in the glossary to distinguish them from regular nouns.
Note that the pronoun no can replace the main noun in this combination.
kirei na apaato	a clean apartment → kirei na no	a clean one
amerika no yuumei na kaisha	a famous company in America →
amerika no yuumei na no	a famouse one in America
3-3-2 Adjective ~Ku Forms as Adverbs
The –ku form of adjectives are also used as adverbs.
Yoku wakarimasu.	I understand it well.
Sugoku kirei desu.	It’s really beautiful.
Yasuku kaimashita.	I bought it cheaply.
Ookiku kakimasu.	I’ll write it big.
Atarashiku tsukurimasu.	I’ll remake it.

Grammar Notes
3-4-1 X toka Y, X ya Y
/Noun to ka Noun/ means that the referenced nouns are examples of the category under discussion. /Noun ya Noun/ is its more formal version. More than two examples can be listed, but it’s unusual to have more than three or four.

Isu toka tsukue, arimasu ka.	Do you have things like chairs and desks?
Isu ya tsukue arimasu ka.	Do you have things like chairs and desks?
Isu toka tsukue toka terebi, arimasu ka. Do you have things like a chair, desk, and TV?
Toka does not require another noun to follow it while ya does. Therefore, the following are possible.
Keitai toka tsukaimasu ka.	Do you use things like smartphone?
Keitai toka sumaho toka tsukaimaus ka.	Do you use things like cellphones and
smartphones?
3-4-2 X mo Y mo - ‘both X and Y’ ‘neither X nor Y’
X mo Y mo means ‘both X and Y’ in an affirmative sentence and ‘neither X nor Y’ in a negative sentence. Compare the three responses below.
Kore to are, irimasu ka.	Do you need this and that?
-Hai, kore mo are mo irimasu.	Yes, I need them both.
-Iie, kore mo are mo irimasen.	No, I don't need either this or that.
-Iie, kore wa irimasu kedo, are wa irimasen. No, I need this, but I don’t need that.
In the first two responses, both items share a similarity, i.e., you need both or you don’t need either, but in the third sentence the two items are being contrasted, i.e. you need one but not the other, thus the particle wa is used.

Grammar Notes
4-1-1 ~mashou, Suggesting or Offering to Do Something
The –mashou form is made by changing -masu to -mashou. A verb in the - mashou form means ‘let’s do X’ or ‘why don’t I do X’. It is used to make a suggestion or offer to do something.
Kaerimashou. Let’s go home.
Tetsudaimashou ka? Shall I help you?
While the speaker is always included as a doer of the action, the addressee might not be included depending on the context.
Ekuseru o tsukai mashou.	Let’s use Excel. Or, Why don’t I use Excel.
Now, how do you respond to a suggestion or an offer made to you?
    • When suggested to do something:
To accept	Sou shimashou.	Let’s do that.
To disagree politely	Iya, chotto….	No, just….
    • When someone has offered to do something for you:
To accept it	Hai, onegai-shimasu.	Yes, please.
To turn it down	Ie, daijoubu desu.	No thank you (I’m fine.)
Note that the question form -mashou ka typically has a falling intonation. It is more polite than -mashou alone because the addressee can say no to the question.
Verbs such as arimasu, dekimasu, and wakarimasu do not occur in the -mashou form because they all indicate something beyond one’s control.
4-1-2 Particle O Marking the Object
Every Japanese sentence has a subject, although it is not always explicitly stated.
On the other hand, the occurrence of an object is more limited. This only occurs with certain verbs (transitive verbs, explained later) and usually does not occur in an adjective or noun sentence. In Lesson 1, it was explained that the object of the verb is placed before the verb with or without the particles wa (contrast) or mo (addition). In this lesson, the particle o is added. Consider the following.
Kore tabemasu.	I’ll eat this.
Kore wa tabemasu.	This, I’ll eat (while I won’t eat that).
Kore mo tabemasu.	I’ll eat this, too.
Kore o tabemasu.	It’s this that I’ll eat.
In all these sentences, kore is the object of the verb tabemasu. When the object is marked by the particle o, the focus is on this item and this item only as the one that you eat. So the last sentence above is typically the answer to the question of ‘what will you eat.’
Depending on the context, what is focused on may be 1) the o-marked object alone or 2) the entire sentence, which presents new information that has not yet been mentioned in the conversation. A very common situation for 1) is in combination with question words (what, who, which, etc.) Question words are inherently focused and thus followed by the particle o (not wa or mo.) Similarly, in a yes-no question, the object, when focused, is marked by the particle o.
    1) The object noun is focused.
Dore o tabemasu ka.	Which one will you eat?
Kore desu.	It’s this.
Kore o tabemasu.	I’ll eat this. (This is the one I’ll eat.)
Now let’s see how yes-no questions are answered when the wrong object is presented. The following are two typical answers.
Pasokon o tsukaimasu ka.	Is it a laptop that you use?
Iya, pasokon ja nai desu. Sumaho desu.
No, it’s not a laptop. It’s a smartphone (that I use.)
Iya, pasokon wa tsukaimasen. Sumaho o tsukaimasu.
No, I don’t use a laptop. I use a smartphone.
Note that in the second answer pasokon takes the particle wa, while sumaho takes the particle o. This is because sumaho is the focused item being newly presented. On the other hand, pasokon has been already mentioned and the particle wa here indicates that pasokon is in contrast to sumaho.
    2) The entire sentence presents new information.
For example, in the dialogue above, the fact that Michael will use Excel is new information and explains why he does not need help. Here are more examples of this type.
Dekakemasen ka?	Won’t you go out?
Iya, nihongo o benkyou-shimasu.	No, I’ll study Japanese.
Purezen desu yo.	It’s a presentation.
Ja, pawaapointo o tsukurimashou.	Well then, let’s make PPT.
4-1-3 Reason + Kara
The clause particle kara connects two sentences together to make one. In the sequence of /Sentence A kara, Sentence B/, Sentence A represents the cause and Sentence B the effect.
Takai desu kara, kaimasen.	Because it’s expensive, I’ll not buy it.
Wakarimasen kara kikimasu.  Because I don’t understand it, I’ll ask.
Sentence B can be left unsaid when it is understood from the context.
Ikimasen ka.	You are not going?
Ee, ame desu kara.	Right, because it’s raining.
The clause particles kara and kedo are opposites of each other. Compare the following.
Takai desu kara, kaimasen.	It’s expensive, so I’ll not buy it.
Takai desu kedo, kaimasu.	It’s expensive, but I’ll buy it.
There are three Japanese words for ‘why.’ Dou shite is most common, naze more formal, and nan de is casual. Desu ka can directly follow them if the rest of the sentence is understood from the context.
Dou shite kaimasen ka?	Why don’t you buy it?
Dou shite desu ka?	Why is it (that you don’t buy it)?

Grammar Notes
4-2-1 Particle Ga Marking the Subject
Recall that the subject of a sentence can be placed in front of a verb, adjective or noun + desu in spoken Japanese without any particle or with the particles wa or mo. In this lesson, the particle ga is added.
Kono apaato,	takai desu. This apartment is expensive
Kono apaato wa takai desu. This apartment is expensive (while others may not).
Kono apaato mo takai desu. This apartment is also expensive.
Kono apaato ga takai desu.	It’s this apartment that is expensive.
The particle ga follows the subject noun in situations where 1) special focus is placed on the subject, or 2) the entire sentence presents new information. Situation 1) commonly occurs in combination with question words. In answering these questions, it is common to use particle ga with the noun, or to just give the noun + desu.
    1) The subject noun is focused.
Dare ga, ikimasu ka.	Who is going?
-Honda-san desu.	It is Honda-san (who is going).
-Honda-san ga ikimasu.	Ms. Honda is going.
In Dialogue 2 above, when Michael suggests making tea, Ms. Honda says Watashi ga iremasu ‘I will make tea (not Michael or anyone)’ putting a focus on her as THE person to make tea. Another similar example in the dialogue is when Michael asks what Ms. Tanaka wants. Michael says nani ga ii desu ka putting a focus on ‘what’.
    2) The entire sentence presents new information.
Kaerimasu ka? Are you going home?
-Hai, shukudai ga arimasu kara. Yes, because I have homework.
Here having homework is new information and explains why the speaker is going home. It’s not shukudai alone that is focused here ( ‘it is homework that I have’) but rather the sentence as a whole is focused ( ‘it’s that I have homework.’)

Grammar Notes
4-3-1 Double-Subject Structures
A Japanese sentence can have more than one subject phrase. This is called a double-subject sentence.
Maikeru-san wa [ohashi daijoubu desu.] Michael is fine with chopsticks.
In the sentence above, ohashi is the subject of the bracketed sentence, and Maikeru-san is the subject of the entire sentence. In other words, the bracketed sentence ‘chopsticks are fine’ is an attribute of or a description about Michael. Similarly, in the examples below, the bracketed sentences are facts about the preceding nouns.
Furansu wa [keeki ga oisii desu].	France has good cake.
Honda-san wa [eigo wa jouzu desu] kedo… Honda-san is good at English, but….
Dare ga [eigo ga dekimasu] ka.	Who can speak English?
Watashi mo [sushi ga suki desu] kedo.	I like sushi, too.
As shown above, both of the subject nouns (inside and outside of the brackets) can take the particles ga, wa, mo, or no particle. Depending on which particle is used, there is a shift in meaning (ga=new information, wa=contrast, mo=addition, or no particle= neutral).
Special note should be taken of nouns such as suki ‘like’, and kirai ‘dislike’, and the verbs such as wakarimasu ‘understand’, dekimasu ‘can do’, arimasu ‘have’, and irimasu ‘need.’ These all indicate a state rather than an action in Japanese. Therefore, unlike their English translations, they do not take an object. What you like, what you understand, etc., can be marked by the particles ga, wa, or mo, or no particle, but not by the particle o.
Honda-san wa sushi ga suki desu.	Ms. Honda likes sushi. Watashi wa terebi wa irimasen.	I don't need a TV. 
Kono daigaku wa arabiago no jyugyou mo arimasu.
This university has an Arabic class, too. 
By the way, there is no such thing as a double-object structure in Japanese. Whew!
4-3-2 Verb Stem + tai ‘want to do x’
Tabetai desu means ‘I want to eat’. To make the tai form of a verb, replace
~masu with ~tai desu.
Tabemasu →	Tabetai desu	I want to eat it.
Mimasu → Mitai desu	I want to see it.
A ~tai form is an adjective. All of its forms follow the adjective patterns.
Table 14. Affirmative, negative, past and non-past forms of the verb tabemasu.

Affirmative
Negative
Non-past
tabetai desu
Tabetaku nai desu Tabetaku arimasen
Past
tabetakatta desu
Tabetaku nakatta desu
Tabetaku arimasen deshita
X-tai desu is typically used to express the speaker’s desire (‘I want to …’) and to ask the addressee’s desire (‘Do you want to…?’) but not a third person’s desire (‘He wants to ….’) Describing other people’s wants will be discussed later.
With the ~tai form, the object of the verb can be marked either by the particle ga or o (ga/o conversion). Both of the following sentences are possible and mean ‘I want to study Japanese.’
Nihongo o benkyou-shitai desu.	What I want to do is to study Japanese.
Nihongo ga benkyou-shitai desu. What I want to study is Japanese.
Unlike the English forms such as ‘do you want to’ or ‘would you like to’, which can be used to invite someone to do something, the ~tai forms are not generally used as invitations or suggestions in Japanese. For invitations and suggestions, negative questions are more commonly used.
Tabemasen ka?	Would you like to eat it? (Invitation)
Tabetai desu ka?	Do you want to eat it?	(Question)
The verbs that do not occur in the ~mashou form also do not occur in the ~tai
form. These include wakarimasu, irimasu, arimasu and dekimasu.

Grammar Notes
4-4-1 More Classifiers: ~hon、~tsu
In Lesson 3, it was explained that when counting things in Japanese, numbers are combined with specific classifiers that are conventionally used for the nouns being counted. We add two classifiers, ~hon、~tsu, in this lesson.
The classifier ~hon is used to count long cylindrical objects such as bottles, pens, umbrellas, bananas, etc. The classifier ~tsu is the most generic classifier, which can be used for both tangible and intangible items such as opinions, meetings, etc. It is also used for items that do not have a special classifier. So, it may be a safe choice when you are not sure what classifier to use.
There are two numerical systems in Japanese: one of Chinese origin, which was introduced in Lesson 3, and another system of Japanese origin. The latter only goes up to the number ten.
1 hito, 2 futa, 3 mi, 4 yo, 5 itsu, 6 mu, 7 nana, 8 ya, 9 kokono, 10 tou
The classifier ~hon is combined with Chinese numerals. Note that alternatives for ~hon are ~pon (for 1, 6, 8, 10) and ~bon (for 3 and how many). The classifier ~tsu is combined with Japanese numerals and for quantities over ten Chinese numerals without a classifier are used: juu-iti, juu-ni, juu-san, etc.

4-4-2 Quantity Expressions
There are two kinds of quantity expressions in Japanese. One is comprised of a number and classifier (san-bon, hito-tsu, etc.) and the other is a general quantity expression (chotto, suskoshi, takusan, zenbu, minna, etc.) Within a sentence they both usually occur right before the verb, adjective, or noun +desu. Unlike English, the noun usually comes before the amount in Japanese.
Biiru, san-bon kudasai.	Three (bottles of) beers, please.
Sashimi wa hito-tsu 1000-en desu.	One sashimi is ¥ 1000.
Mizu o sukoshi nomitai desu.	I want to drink a little bit of water.
As shown in the examples above, a quantity expression is typically marked by the lack of a particle. It is not followed by the particle ga or o. However, it can be followed by the particle wa or mo. When wa follows a quantity expression, it means ‘at least’ and when mo follows it, it implies that the number is big (that much!)
Mainichi, shukudai ga hito-tsu wa arimasu.
I have at least one HW assignment everyday.
Obentou o futatsu mo tabemashita. I ate all two bentos.
How are multiple items and numbers listed up in Japanese? Suppose we want to say ‘Three apples and four oranges, please.’ Combine the following two sentences into one.
Ringo o mit-tsu kudasai.	Three apples, please.
Mikan o yot-tsu kudasai.	Four oranges, please.
→ [Ringo o mit-tsu] to [mikan o yot-tsu] kudasai.
Three apples and four oranges, please.
There is no limit on how many things can be listed, but it is rare to list more than three items.
Onigiri ga mit-tsu to sando ga itsu-tsu, sorekara mizu ga ni-hon arimasu.
There are three onigiri, five sandwiches, and two bottles of water.
