Instructor’s Directions 
The following sentences are for in-class use by the teacher to provide students with directions.

The goal is to avoid using English in the classroom from the very beginning of the course.

Itte kudasai.	言ってください。	Please say it.
こた

い
X-san ni itte kudasai.	Ｘさんに言ってください。Please say it to Mr/s. X.
Greetings and Ritual Expressions 
Common daily greetings and ritual expressions are introduced here. The dialogues below provide sample contexts. A vocabulary list follows each dialogue with some notes. Additional items are marked with +.
It is recommended that rather than memorizing words in isolation, you learn them through the dialogue along with appropriate body language.
First listen to the accompanying audio and practice each line aloud. Add on one line at a time. Stand up where appropriate. Practice alternatives for different contexts.
Greetings

B: Ohayou gozaimasu.		おはようございます。	Good morning.
Ohayou	おはよう			Good morning
Ohayou gozaimasu		おはようございます	Good morning (polite)
+Konnichiwa			こんにちは			Hello
+Konbanwa			んばんは			Good evening
Gozaimasu indicates politeness and formality. People who know each other well (family members, good friends) can use the short form. You should never use the short form with your superiors (teacher, boss, supervisor). Konnichiwa and konbanwa cover both formal and informal situations.
Offering and Accepting, Thanking

Douzo is used to offer things or invite people to go ahead.
Arigatou (gozaimasu) expresses thanks in general. You should never use the short form with your superiors (teacher, boss, supervisor). Doumo expresses gratitude or apology. It can also be combined with arigatou gozaimasu (‘Thank you very much’) or sumimasen (‘I’m very sorry’). Gozaimashita indicates past and is used when the act is completed.

~san is a title that can be attached to a given name, a family name, and even some roles. Don’t attach it to your own name or the names of people in your group when talking to outsiders.
~sensei is a title that can be attached to teachers, professors, doctors, etc. You should not use ~san to refer to your teacher.
Hai means ‘that’s right,’ ‘present’ (in roll call), or ‘here you are’ (handing something over).

Notes on Pronunciation
Syllables
Japanese syllables are constructed in the following four ways.
    • a vowel (a, i, u, e, o)
    • a consonant + a vowel (62 combinations)
    • a consonant alone (n, t, s, k, p)
    • a consonant + y + a vowel (33 combinations) 
The chart below shows all the syllables in Japanese.

Table 1.  Syllables in Japanese

Note the following special cases marked with emphasis in the chart:
    • /s+i/ is pronounced /shi/
    • /z+i/ is pronounced /ji/
    • /t+i/ is pronounced /chi/
    • /t+u/ is pronounced /tsu/
    • /d+i/ is pronounced /ji/
    • /d+u/ is pronounced /zu/
Long Vowels
There are five long vowels in Japanese: /aa/, /ii/, /uu/, /ee/, and /oo/. They are “long” in terms of spoken duration. In the writing system, the long versions of /a/, /i/, and /u/ are recognized as the same sound: /aa/, /ii/, /uu/. But the long version of /o/ (with certain exceptions) is represented by /ou/ and the long version of /e/ (with certain exceptions) is written as /ei/.
Long Consonants
The consonants /t/, /s/, /k/, and /p/ can be long. When these consonants constitute an entire syllable without a vowel, they are not pronounced but take a full syllable length.
    • 6 syllables: i-t-te ki-ma-su	‘I’m leaving.’
    • 3 syllables: I-p-pon	‘one long thing’
    • 3 syllables: I-k-ko	‘one round thing’
    • 3 syllables: i-s-sho	‘together’
The consonant /n/ can take up an entire syllable by itself, as in konnichiwa’ hello’ (5 syllables: ko-n-ni-chi-wa).
Pitch Accent
As you listen to Japanese, you will notice rises and falls in pitch. Pitch can change from syllable to syllable in order to distinguish meaning. For example, there is a fall in pitch in hai ‘yes’, while there is a rise in hai ‘ash’. The difference in pitch pattern distinguishes these two words. This is called pitch accent.
HAi ‘yes’
haI ‘ash’	(The high pitch is indicated by the capital and emphasis.)
On the other hand, in English a difference in loudness serves this function. This is called stress accent. Compare the following.
INsult (noun)
inSULT (verb)	(The loud syllable is indicated by the capital and emphasis.) All Japanese words have one of the following pitch patterns:
Fall:	JAa	‘well then’
DOumo	‘thanks’
DOuzo	‘go ahead’

Rise:	iIE	‘no’
saYONARA	‘good bye’
taDAIMA	‘I’m home’
oHAYOU	‘good morning’
yoROSHIKU	‘Nice to meet you’
	Rise and Fall:
aRIgatou	‘thanks’
shiTSUrei-shimasu ‘Excuse me’ suMIMASEn	‘Sorry’
If a word has only one syllable, a fall or a rise occurs with the following word.
HA desu. ‘It’s a tooth.’ ha DEsu. ‘It’s a leaf.’
A note on the cultural significance of pitch is in order. As you learn Japanese, pay attention to pitch at the sentence level as well as the word level. A slight change in pitch may indicate a subtle but significant change in meaning or mood. It is observed in many, if not all, languages that speakers tend to raise their pitch when talking to babies or when trying to sound gentle. Japanese is no exception in this regard. Talking in a high pitch is generally associated with politeness in Japanese. Women tend to talk in a higher pitch, but regardless of the gender, sales and customer service personnel, receptionists, waiters, etc. speak in overall higher pitch. Remember that when something is the norm and expected in a culture and you don’t follow it, you may be sending a certain message inadvertently. Just to be safe, bow, smile, and talk gently.
